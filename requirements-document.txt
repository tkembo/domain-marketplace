WHMCS Domain Marketplace Module - Requirements Document

Domain Listing

Registered users (sellers) should be able to list domains for auction that they own on the platform.
Sellers are listing domains they have transferred to the platform, so there's no need for additional ownership verification.
Each domain listing should include: domain name, auction type (English or Dutch), starting bid, current highest bid, and time remaining.
Sellers should be able to set a 'Buy Now' price for immediate purchase.
Sellers should be able to set the duration of the auction in days.
Domain Information: Sellers can provide a brief description or history about the domain.
Visibility: Sellers can decide if their listing is public (visible to all users) or private (visible only to those with a direct link).
Bidding Process

Only registered users (bidders) can bid.
Each new bid must be higher than the current bid.
Bidding Increments: Define minimum bidding increments to ensure fair competition.
Notifications: Bidders should receive notifications when they are outbid.
Proxy Bidding: Bidders can set a maximum bid amount, allowing the system to automatically bid on their behalf until this maximum is reached.
'Buy Now' option allows immediate purchase of the domain at the set price, bypassing the auction process.
Auction End

At the end of the auction, the domain is automatically assigned to the highest bidder.
Payment Methods: The module will rely on WHMCS for handling payments and won't have its own payment method.
Domain Transfer: Outline the process for domain transfer once the auction ends. Specify whether this will be manual or if there will be integration with domain registrars for automated transfers.
Note: This module will rely on WHMCS for payment processing, currency support, and user balance management. The initial version will not include user ratings, dispute resolution, or analytics features.
